	<h4>Becoming The Pickle.</h4>
	</header>

		<section>
			<p> The story began when I got my first job at Target when I was 16. During orientation I thought we were suppose to put nicknames on our badges such as Nighthalwk or Strawberry Shortcake, so I thought what better name to do than the very best...<b>PICKLE</b>. Since that day everyone believed my real name was pickle <em>(besides HR of course)</em> and I got so tired of correcting the customers, so I finally went along with it. Yes maam my name is Pickle, yes sir it is European... Its actually pronounced PEECKEEL. <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5q9uPPzOPsQAE/giphy.gif" align="right" width="480" height="480">
