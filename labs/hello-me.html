<p> Hi, My name is Madison Castello. I am majoring in Architecture and earning a certificate in TAM. My favorite color is blue. I have four brothers and one sister. I was born in Florida and my family currently lives in Germany. I am Greek and Italian. I love food, running, hiking, four wheeling, school, my family, drawing, model making, sharks, hanging out with friends, scary movies, snow, dogs (German Shepards to be specific), exploring, and adventuring.
